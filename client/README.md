# Introduction

pretty bls is a chart rendering website that uses API data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.  The user can select seperate time series lengths for different data series for the BLS, and also read information regarding the selected study.

## Why pretty bls?

The need to disply data in a clean way is important.  I wanted a way to render chart data cleanly, using the framework d3 inegrated with React.

## Technology

pretty-bls is a Front-React app featuring asynchronous API calls to a 3rd party API.  The project uses Context for managing props and handler function.

+ ReactJS
+ d3
+ Axios
+ React Router
+ HTML 5
+ CSS3

## Learning Project
pretty bls is a learning project to get comfortable with using React, Context, and Axios / async functions.  I also took the oppertunity to work with d3 to learn more about the d3 framework, as well as integrate the two frameworks together on a single project.
